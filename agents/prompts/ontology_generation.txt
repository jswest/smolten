Analyze this CSV data and generate a comprehensive tag ontology for categorizing the rows.

Data Overview:
- Shape: {shape} (rows x columns)
- Columns: {columns}
- Sample data: {sample_data}

Requirements:
1. Generate approximately {tag_count} meaningful tags/categories
2. Tags should be mutually exclusive but comprehensive
3. Consider the content, patterns, and themes in the data
4. Each tag should have a clear description
5. Provide examples of which rows would match each tag

Return a JSON object with this structure:
{{
    "ontology": {{
        "tag_name_1": {{
            "description": "Clear description of what this tag represents",
            "criteria": "Specific criteria for assigning this tag",
            "examples": ["Example patterns or keywords that would match"]
        }},
        // ... more tags
    }},
    "metadata": {{
        "total_tags": {tag_count},
        "data_summary": "Brief summary of the data analyzed",
        "coverage_estimate": "Estimated percentage of data that would be tagged"
    }}
}}

Focus on creating tags that are:
- Semantically meaningful
- Practically useful for organization
- Balanced in coverage (avoid too many rare or too many common tags)
- Based on the actual content patterns observed

Analyze the data thoroughly and generate the ontology:
